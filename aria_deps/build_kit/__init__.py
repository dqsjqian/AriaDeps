"""Shared build pipeline kit for C++ projects.

This subpackage provides the mechanics of a complete build pipeline
(deps -> build -> test -> bench -> package). Each project supplies its
own configuration (dependencies, CMake flags, platform quirks).

Public API:
    Pipeline: Main entry point. Configure with project-specific settings,
              then call .run().
    QtSupport: Feature mixin for Qt6-based projects.
    DllDeploy: Post-build step for Windows DLL deployment.

Example:
    from aria_deps.build_kit import Pipeline

    Pipeline(
        name="my-project",
        deps=[("third-party", ["python", "tools/fetch_deps.py"])],
        cmake_flags={"MY_OPTION": "ON"},
    ).run()
